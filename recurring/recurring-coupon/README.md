# Overview

This repository contains an example script demonstrating basic Subscription orchestration.

In particular we demonstrate, how you as a merchant would pause and resume a single subscription.

# Installation

Run once:

```bash
yarn
```

# Setup

1. Set your Sphere ApiKey in your environment variables.

```bash
export API_KEY="<SPHERE_API_KEY>"
```

2. Retrieve the id of the subscription that you would like to pause/resume and set it as an environment variable.

```bash
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID="subscription_adg5186sad88bba6d35186dsg5c"
```

# Run

To run the script:

```bash
yarn run dev
```
