# Overview

This repository contains an example Nextjs app, demonstrating how to natively embed a Sphere payment button into your web app.

This repository will be useful to you if you:

1. Want to build your own custom payment pages or embed a pay button into your application
1. Don't want to use Sphere's prebuilt checkouts.
1. Want to minimize dependencies by foregoing use of the `@spherelabs/react` library.

# Installation

Run once:

```bash
yarn
```

# Development

To start the server on port :3000 run:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

## Notes:

Generally recommend using our react SDK, `@spherelabs/react` if it fits your use-case. Refer to `nextjs-react-sdk` for an example usage.
